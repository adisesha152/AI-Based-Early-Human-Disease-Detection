🚀 AI-Based Early Human Disease Detection

🏆 TechXcelerate BITS Goa 2025

📌 Overview

AI-Based Early Human Disease Detection is a machine learning-powered web application that analyzes medical data and symptoms to predict potential diseases early. The project utilizes React.js for the frontend, Node.js & Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for machine learning models.

✨ Features

✅ User-Friendly Interface – Built with React.js for seamless navigation.
✅ AI-Powered Predictions – Uses trained ML models to classify diseases based on symptoms.
✅ RESTful API Integration – Backend API with Node.js & Express.js.
✅ Secure & Scalable Database – MongoDB for storing user and disease data.
✅ Real-Time Predictions – Fast and efficient disease detection using TensorFlow & Scikit-learn models.
